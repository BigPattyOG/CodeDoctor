## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities responsibly.

### Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to this repository on GitHub
2. Click **Security**
3. Click **Advisories**
4. Click **New draft security advisory**

This allows private discussion and coordinated disclosure.

### Alternative: GitHub Issue (non-sensitive details only)
If you cannot use a Security Advisory, open a GitHub issue. **Do not include**
secrets, private tokens, or proof-of-concept exploit code that would put users
at risk.

### What to include
- A clear description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce (as minimal as possible)
- Affected versions (if known)
- Any suggested mitigation or fix

### Response expectations
- You should receive an initial response within **7 days**
- If accepted, we will work on a fix and publish an update to PyPI
- If declined, we will explain why (when possible)

Thank you for helping keep CodeDoctor and its users safe.
